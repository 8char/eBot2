# 💵 eBot2 (The continuation of eBot)

A discord bot used to sell services/products.

## 📝 Features

**Commands:**

- `/ping` - Gets the Client & API Latency for eBot.
- `/setup` - Sets up all of the neccessary channels so that you can begin selling your products. *W.I.P*
- `/package` - Sets up a package for you that you can then sell. *W.I.P*

## 🤖 Installation

To install the bot simply clone the repository to a computer and then run `yarn install` (If you don't have yarn installed, then run `npm install -g yarn`) or `npm install`, this should install all neccessary packages.

After that you need to create a `.env` file inside of the root directory with the following content:

```text
CLIENT_TOKEN=[YOUR_BOT_TOKEN]
OWNER=[YOUR_CLIENT_ID]
```

You can then start the bot using `yarn development` or `yarn production`. Each mode will differ, especially in the ammount of logging it makes to certain channels. More documentation on this will be written at a later date when it gets implemented.
